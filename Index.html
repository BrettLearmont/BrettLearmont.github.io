            About/Skills: &nbsp;

            I am currently a Junior at the University of Oklahoma. I am studying Management Information Systems
            and Finance in order to get a grasp of the technological word we are currently in. In pursing both these
            majors, I take pride in understanding the versatility that they offer. I have motivated myself each day
            to learn the ease Excell offers to daily activities such as budgeting, or being the wonder it brings to making
            school work as efficient as possible. Along with that, learing another language in programming, C# that is. The
            struggles each of these majors brings is undeniable, but to strive where you want to be is within.

            Projects: &nbsp;

            A project that brins me confidence in majoring in MIS is one that took place in a class offered
            at OU called Databases. In this class, we worked as teams of 5 to understand SQL, ERD's and the tiny
            details in between. We provided help for one another in the goup, in order to solve a problem for
            a company our professor made up. We started with otulining the ERD, to better understand what the client
            (our teacher) really wanted. After getting feedback on that, our team would meet twice a week to resolve
            any problems we had and then move onto the following steps. It was a very rewarding and team building
            project that taught me valuable lessons such as the importance of time management, communication,
            and feedback.
